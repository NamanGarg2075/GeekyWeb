## jQuery ajax() success, error VS .done(), .fail()

**success and Error :**
A **success** callback that gets invoked upon successful completion of an Ajax request.

A **failure** callback that gets invoked in case there is any error while making the request.

**Example:**

```js
$.ajax({
  url: "URL",
  type: "POST",
  data: yourData,
  datatype: "json",
  success: function (data) {
    successFunction(data);
  },
  error: function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {
    errorFunction();
  },
});
```

**.done() and .fail() :**

.ajax().done(function(data, textStatus, jqXHR){});
Replaces method .success() which was deprecated in jQuery 1.8.This is an alternative construct for the success callback function above.

.ajax().fail(function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown){});
Replaces method .error() which was deprecated in jQuery 1.8.This is an alternative construct for the complete callback function above.

**Example:**

```js
$.ajax({
  url: "URL",
  type: "POST",
  data: yourData,
  datatype: "json",
})
  .done(function (data) {
    successFunction(data);
  })
  .fail(function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {
    serrorFunction();
  });
```

## Basic promise creation

Here is a very simple example of a function that "**promises** to proceed when a given time elapses". It does that by creating a new `Deferred` object, that is resolved later and returning the Deferred's promise:

```js
function waitPromise(milliseconds) {
  // Create a new Deferred object using the jQuery static method
  var def = $.Deferred();

  // Do some asynchronous work - in this case a simple timer
  setTimeout(function () {
    // Work completed... resolve the deferred, so it's promise will proceed
    def.resolve();
  }, milliseconds);

  // Immediately return a "promise to proceed when the wait time ends"
  return def.promise();
}
```

And use like this:

```js
waitPromise(2000).then(function () {
  console.log("I have waited long enough");
});
```

## Get the current state of a promise

By default the state of a promise is pending when it is created. The state of a promise is changed when the deferred object which created the promise either resolves/rejects it.

```js
var deferred = new $.Deferred();
var d1 = deferred.promise({
  prop: "value",
});
var d2 = $("div").promise();
var d3 = $("div").hide(1000).promise();

console.log(d1.state()); // "pending"
console.log(d2.state()); // "resolved"
console.log(d3.state()); // "pending"
```

## Asynchronous Promises Chaining

If you have multiple asynchronous tasks that needs to occur one after the other, you will need to chain together their promise objects. Here is a simple example:

```js
function First() {
  console.log("Calling Function First");
  return $.get("/ajax/GetFunction/First");
}

function Second() {
  console.log("Calling Function Second");
  return $.get("/ajax/GetFunction/Second");
}

function Third() {
  console.log("Calling Function Third");
  return $.get("/ajax/GetFunction/Third");
}

function log(results) {
  console.log("Result from previous AJAX call: " + results.data);
}

First().done(log).then(Second).done(log).then(Third).done(log);
```
