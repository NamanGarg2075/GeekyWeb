title: Loops in Kotlin
description: Discover the power of loops in Kotlin and unlock efficient ways to iterate and control the flow of your code. This comprehensive guide provides insights into the various loop structures available in Kotlin, including for loops, while loops, and do-while loops. Learn how to leverage these constructs to automate repetitive tasks, iterate over collections, and perform conditional checks. Dive deep into loop optimization techniques, such as loop labels and break/continue statements, to fine-tune your code for enhanced performance. Mastering loops in Kotlin will empower you to write cleaner, more concise, and highly maintainable code

## Looping over iterables

You can loop over any iterable by using the standard for-loop:

```kotlin
val list = listOf("Hello", "World", "!")
for(str in list) {
    print(str)
}
```

Lots of things in Kotlin are iterable, like number ranges:

```kotlin
for(i in 0..9) {
    print(i)
}
```

If you need an index while iterating:

```kotlin
for((index, element) in iterable.withIndex()) {
    print("$element at index $index")
}
```

There is also a functional approach to iterating included in the standard library, without apparent language constructs, using the forEach function:

```kotlin
iterable.forEach {
    print(it.toString())
}
```

`it` in this example implicitly holds the current element, see [Lambda Functions](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/kotlin/1280/functions/4199/lambda-functions)

## Repeat an action x times

```kotlin
repeat(10) { i ->
    println("This line will be printed 10 times")
    println("We are on the ${i + 1}. loop iteration")
}
```

## Break and continue

Break and continue keywords work like they do in other languages.

```kotlin
while(true) {
    if(condition1) {
        continue // Will immediately start the next iteration, without executing the rest of the loop body
    }
    if(condition2) {
        break // Will exit the loop completely
    }
}
```

If you have nested loops, you can label the loop statements and qualify the break and continue statements to specify which loop you want to continue or break:

```kotlin
outer@ for(i in 0..10) {
    inner@ for(j in 0..10) {
        break       // Will break the inner loop
        break@inner // Will break the inner loop
        break@outer // Will break the outer loop
    }
}
```

This approach won't work for the functional `forEach` construct, though.

## Iterating over a Map in kotlin

```kotlin
//iterates over a map, getting the key and value at once

var map = hashMapOf(1 to "foo", 2 to "bar", 3 to "baz")

for ((key, value) in map) {
    println("Map[$key] = $value")
}
```

## Recursion

Looping via recursion is also possible in Kotlin as in most programming languages.

```kotlin
fun factorial(n: Long): Long = if (n == 0) 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)

println(factorial(10)) // 3628800
```

In the example above, the `factorial` function will be called repeatedly by itself until the given condition is met.

## While Loops

While and do-while loops work like they do in other languages:

```kotlin
while(condition) {
    doSomething()
}

do {
    doSomething()
} while (condition)
```

In the do-while loop, the condition block has access to values and variables declared in the loop body.

## Functional constructs for iteration

The [Kotlin Standard Library](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/index.html) also provides numerous useful functions to iteratively work upon collections.

For example, the [`map`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/map.html) function can be used to transform a list of items.

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0)
val numberStrings = numbers.map { "Number $it" }
```

One of the many advantages of this style is it allows to chain operations in a similar fashion. Only a minor modification would be required if say, the list above were needed to be filtered for even numbers. The [`filter`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/filter.html) function can be used.

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0)
val numberStrings = numbers.filter { it % 2 == 0 }.map { "Number $it" }
```

## Remarks

In Kotlin, loops are compiled down to optimized loops wherever possible. For example, if you iterate over a number range, the bytecode will be compiled down to a corresponding loop based on plain int values to avoid the overhead of object creation.
