## Introduction

[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (**H**yper**t**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage) uses a markup system composed of elements which represent specific content. **Markup** means that with HTML you declare **what** is presented to a viewer, not **how** it is presented. Visual representations are defined by [Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) and realized by browsers. [Still existing elements that allow for such](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/obsolete.html#non-conforming-features), like e.g. [`font`](https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/font), "are entirely obsolete, and must not be used by authors".

:::info
HTML is sometimes called a programming language but it has no logic, so is a **markup language**. HTML tags provide semantic meaning and machine-readability to the content in the page.
:::

An element usually consists of an opening tag (`<element_name>`), a closing tag (`</element_name>`), which contain the element's name surrounded by angle brackets, and the content in between: `<element_name>...content...</element_name>`

There are some HTML elements that don't have a closing tag or any contents. These are called [void elements](https://stackoverflow.com/documentation/html/1449/void-elements). Void elements include `<img>`, `<meta>`, `<link>` and `<input>`.

Element names can be thought of as descriptive keywords for the content they contain, such as `video`, `audio`, `table`, `footer`.

A HTML page may consist of potentially hundreds of elements which are then read by a web browser, interpreted and rendered into human readable or audible content on the screen.

For this document it is important to note the difference between elements and tags:

**Elements:** `video`, `audio`, `table`, `footer`

**Tags:** `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<table>`, `<footer>`, `</html>`, `</body>`
