## Hello World

All Kotlin programs start at the `main` function. Here is an example of a simple Kotlin "Hello World" program:

```kotlin
package my.program

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("Hello, world!")
}
```

Place the above code into a file named `Main.kt` (this filename is entirely arbitrary)

When targeting the JVM, the function will be compiled as a static method in a class with a name derived from the filename. In the above example, the main class to run would be `my.program.MainKt`.

To change the name of the class that contains top-level functions for a particular file, place the following annotation at the top of the file above the package statement:

```kotlin
@file:JvmName("MyApp")
```

In this example, the main class to run would now be `my.program.MyApp`.
