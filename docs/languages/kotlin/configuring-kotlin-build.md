## Gradle configuration

`kotlin-gradle-plugin` is used to compile Kotlin code with Gradle. Basically, its version should correspond to the Kotlin version you want to use. E.g. if you want to use Kotlin `1.0.3`, then you need to aplly `kotlin-gradle-plugin` version `1.0.3` too.

It's a good idea to externalize this version in [`gradle.properties`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:gradle_configuration_properties) or in [`ExtraPropertiesExtension`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.plugins.ExtraPropertiesExtension.html):

```kotlin
buildscript {
   ext.kotlin_version = '1.0.3'

   repositories {
     mavenCentral()
   }

   dependencies {
     classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
   }
}
```

Then you need to apply this plugin to your project. The way you do this differs when targeting different platforms:

### Targeting JVM

```kotlin
apply plugin: 'kotlin'
```

### Targeting Android

```kotlin
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'
```

### Targeting JS

```kotlin
apply plugin: 'kotlin2js'
```

These are the default paths:

- kotlin sources: `src/main/kotlin`
- java sources: `src/main/java`
- kotlin tests: `src/test/kotlin`
- java tests: `src/test/java`
- runtime resources: `src/main/resources`
- test resources: `src/test/resources`

You may need to configure [`SourceSets`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.SourceSet.html) if you're using custom project layout.

Finally, you'll need to add Kotlin standard library dependency to your project:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    compile "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:$kotlin_version"
}
```

If you want to use Kotlin Reflection you'll also need to add `compile "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-reflect:$kotlin_version"`

## Using Android Studio

Android Studio can configure Kotlin automatically in an Android project.

### Install the plugin

To install the Kotlin plugin, go to `File > Settings > Editor > Plugins > Install JetBrains Plugin... > Kotlin > Install`, then restart Android Studio when prompted.

### Configure a project

Create an Android Studio project as normal, then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>. In the search box, type "Configure Kotlin in Project" and press Enter.

Android Studio will alter your Gradle files to add all the necessary dependencies.

### Converting Java

To convert your Java files to Kotlin files, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> and find "Convert Java File to Kotlin File". This will change the current file's extension to `.kt` and convert the code to Kotlin.

## Migrating from Gradle using Groovy script to Kotlin script

Steps:

- clone the [gradle-script-kotlin](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-script-kotlin) project
- copy/paste from the cloned project to your project:
  - `build.gradle.kts`
  - `gradlew`
  - `gradlew.bat`
  - `settings.gradle`
- update the content of the `build.gradle.kts` based on your needs, you can use as inspiration the scripts in the project just cloned or in one of its samples
- now open Intellij and open your project, in the explorer window, it should be recognized as a Gradle project, if not, expand it first.
- after opening, let Intellij works, open `build.gradle.kts` and check if there are any error. If the highlighting is not working and/or is everything marked red, then close and reopen Intellij
- open the Gradle window and refresh it

If you are on Windows, you may encounter this [bug](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-script-kotlin/issues/220), download the full Gradle 3.3 distribution and use that instead the one provided. [Related](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-script-kotlin/issues/220).

OSX and Ubuntu work out of the box.

Small bonus, if you want to avoid all the hassle of publicing on Maven and similar, use [Jitpack](https://github.com/elect86/glm/blob/master/build.gradle.kts), the lines to add are almost identical compared to Groovy. You can take inspiration from this [project](https://github.com/elect86/glm/blob/master/build.gradle.kts) of mine.
